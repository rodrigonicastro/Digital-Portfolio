      <h1 class="text-center">About Me</h1>
      <p class="mt-4">I am a fourth-year Computer Science student in the University of Colorado Boulder. I am from a small town near SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil, and have been living in the USA since I started studying at CU in Fall 2022. I am majoring in Computer Science with a B.A, and I'm also doing 2 minors: one in Computer Engineering and one in Business. If you're curious about the decision behind these minors, there are a couple good reasons. First, I'm doing a Bachelor of Arts program, so I am required to have at least one additional area of study. I chose Computer Engineering because I think it gives me a more complete outlook into programs, since I will have a more structured understanding of how things work inside a computer. And I also chose to do the Business Minor because I feel like it can give me a different view into things, one that's technical, but doesn't limit itself to that, giving me a more diversified perspective.</p>
      <h1 class="text-center">Purpose/Audience</h1>
      <p>The purpose of this Digital Portfolio is to display my experiences to anyone who might be interested in learning more about me and my works related to Computer Science. With that, I expect the majority of people visiting this website to be potential employers and recruiters, but anyone who wants to get to know me is welcome!</p>
      <h1 class="text-center">Content</h1>
      <p>Here you will find information about my interests, projects, and anything else that I feel is relevant about myself. Most importantly, I want to highlight some projects that I have worked on in the past, that I fell can display my skills as a programmer.</p>
